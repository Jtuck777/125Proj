Ok boys here's my thoughts:
To limit the amount of memory required, we need to scan the file,
seperate and store each individual token in order that they are scanned.
Then Print them out with labeled based on their proper value.
I think we should write a function that scans the file and identifies if
something is a token or not, then copies each token into a fifo linked list
to preserve the order they are in the file.
LinkedList ScanFile(inputStream);
Then we just need to write function that can identify the token type.
TokenType Lexeme(Token);
We then iterate through the linked list using the lexeme on each node and
print the lexeme output and the token value from the linked list.
Maybe write a class that defines what each token is otherwise we would
just output a string such as "ID", "NUM", "REAL"...etc
